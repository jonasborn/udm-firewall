# About
Yea... there is the Unifi Dream Machine with its own integrated firewall and
there is a totally missing function to import and export firewall rules.
And because art-of-wifi crated an amazing api client for the Unifi series, I've created
an firewall import and export system.

See art-of-wifi/unifi-api-client
